# Example wdf files 
The github repo only contains dummy file objects. You should download
the files from [the binary
release](https://github.com/alchem0x2A/py-wdf-reader/releases/download/binary/spectra_files.zip)
and replace all files within this directory for successful running the
example scripts.
